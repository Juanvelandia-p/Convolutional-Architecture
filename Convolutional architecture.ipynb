    "## 1.Dataset Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fashion-MNIST dataset is well suited for convolutional neural networks because it consists of image-based data with clear spatial structure. Each image represents a clothing item where local visual features such as edges, contours, and shapes are essential for correct classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers are particularly effective at capturing these local patterns through shared filters and spatial hierarchies, making CNNs more appropriate than fully connected networks for this task. Additionally, the dataset contains multiple balanced classes and uniform image dimensions, which facilitates efficient training and evaluation of convolutional models."
